# Digitized-Environment-Monitoring-System-DEMS
```DEMS```, also termed as ```'Digitized-Environment-Monitoring-System'```, is an Arduino-based project.

```DEMS``` aids to monitor the environment, by gathering```realtime-data``` from the ```Arduino``` and various ```sensors```, like Temperature & Humidity sensor,Barometric sensor, etc.

```DEMS``` also generates ```plots``` based on the various ```Environment conditions``` or parameters, like Temperature, Pressure, etc. These plots can be used for further analysis and predictions.

## Introduction
 
-	Environment monitoring systems are used to garner data and provide weather information of a certain area.
-	It is mainly used to measure and forecast weather conditions.

-	The Arduino based Digitized Environment Monitoring System, can show you ambient temperature, humidity, pressure, dust density, light intensity, altitude and much more data from your surroundings.
- These observations can be used to predict weather from home or any other place at your convenience.

## DEMS Working Details

-	DEMS is built around Arduino, which is called the brain of the weather station.
-	It collects and processes huge amount of data from various sensors.
-	Finally, it uses the WIFI module (ESP8266 NODEMCU) to post it on the ThingSpeak platform for visualization.

-	The best part of this project is that with the help of ThingSpeak platform we can visualize the weather related data in any browser.

-	The circuit consists of ‘Four sensors’:

     1.	Temperature & Humidity sensor (DHT22):
     It is a 4-pin sensor, which senses temperature and humidity from the surroundings and passes it to the Arduino.

     2.	Barometric sensor (BMP180): 
      It measures atmospheric pressure, altitude and temperature (we neglect temperature measurement from this sensor as we have a dedicated sensor for measuring ambient temperature).

     3.	Dust sensor (GP2Y1010AU0F):
     It is an air monitoring module which monitors the air quality and detects fine particles like dust (particle larger than 0.8micrometer).

     4.	Light sensor (LDR): 
     This 3-pin LDR  sensor detects ambient brightness & light intensity .

-	The above mentioned sensors collect relevant data and passes it to the Arduino.

-	The data obtained from the Arduino board is sent to the ESP8266 NODEMCU through serial communication, which is then passed on to ThingSpeak via Wi-Fi. 

-	For Wi-Fi networking we use a Wi-Fi module (ESP8266 NODEMCU) which connects to internet to fetch or upload data.
-	Using this module we transfer the data to ThingSpeak platform for convenient and easier visualization.
